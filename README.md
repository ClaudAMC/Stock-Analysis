# Stock-Analysis
---
## Overview of Project
Steve would like to help his parents with their investments. We created a workbook for him that would help with his research, however, he wants to expand the dataset to multiple years. Our original workbook may work for smaller datasets but if the dataset is expanded it may take a long time to execute. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor the origional VBA script in order to make it run more efficiently and decrease its execution time. Using this script the stock performance for 2017 and 2018 were evaluated and compared.

## Analysis and Refactoring

The file and scripts; original and refactored can be found in the file below:
